Jupyter Notebook (Octave Kernel) alternatives for Numerical Methods laboratories @ UPB

## Introduction

Why [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)?
As they say on their official website, it allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
It's easier to organize tutorials and laboratories into notebooks which can be easily modified by students and verified by assistants.

## Installation
### Jupyter Notebook

Follow this [link](http://jupyter.org/install) to install Jupyter Notebook.

### Octave Kernel for Jupyter Notebook

You can install the Octave Kernel with the following command `pip install octave_kernel --user`.

## How to use Jupyter Notebook

Go to the directory of the laboratory and run `jupyter notebook`.
Access the `.ipynb` file and go through the cells with the arrows or with `Shift + Enter` to execute a cell and go to the next one.
Every cell can be modified and re-run at any time.
All the variables are saved as you execute the cells and give them different values, it's exactly as an interpreted language.
